# bloodSampleImageAnalysis

The project is about developing a simple, reliable and cost-effective testing platform for detection of certain types of biomarkers in blood samples by taking images from a smart phone camera.

Such a project will be of great importance to the community. Detecting cancer biomarkers from a drop of blood reliably and quickly will improve health-care systems. Such a system will make testing easier and deliver results very quickly.

Also, if the application can display messages in accordance with the measurements, the user need not be a practitioner of medicine or a trained professional. By following simple instructions anyone can obtain analysis on a drop of blood in a cost-effective manner.
